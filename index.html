    <h1>What Is "Lean," and Where Did It Come From?</h1>


    <div class="byline">By Talib Visram</div>

    <P class="main-text">
      The opioid crisis is a major story, but one drug that appears to be contributing to the epidemic is not being addressed. That drug, or drug cocktail, more accurately, is "lean." Its base is cough syrup with codeine – an opioid.

      <br><br> It’s a “cocktail” because it’s taken as a drink: the syrup is mixed with Sprite or flavored soda, and candy such as Jolly Ranchers, and usually poured into a Styrofoam cup with ice. “It’s sweet and tasty, and it’s thick,” says Dr. Ronald
      Peters, a professor of public health at the University of Texas.

      <br><br> But the syrup is dangerous: Peters says the codeine is essentially “liquid heroin.” It contains promethazine, an antihistamine that causes drowsiness, and it’s also 7% alcohol.

      <br><br> People take it for its sedative sensation. Dr. Laura Agnich, an associate professor of criminal justice and criminology at Georgia Southern University, says it’s a “cardiovascular depressant.” This explains the name “lean,” so-called because
      of its effect of making users lean over.

      <br><br> It has several other nicknames: it’s also widely known as “purple drank” (for its color when mixed with grape-flavored candy), “sizzurp” (a variation of syrup), “Texas tea” (for its Texan origin) and “barre” (referring to Barr Pharmaceuticals,
      one of the original producers of the syrup).

      The history of sizzurp began in Houston. In the 1950s, blues musicians used to mix Robitussin with beer. In the 1980s and ’90s, the next generation would turn from the over-the-counter syrup to the stronger codeine syrup. These users grew up in the same
      neighborhoods as the bluesmen, but this was a hip-hop generation.

      <br><br> And so, lean became associated with hip hop – especially with the influence of DJ Screw in the 1990s. He invented a form of hip hop called “chopped and screwed,” essentially records slowed down to fit the hot, hazy Houston lifestyle, a
      perfect soundtrack for when sitting in the city’s slow-moving traffic. Most significantly, the depressant, lean, became the drug to complement this music and lifestyle.

      <br><br> Lean therefore became glamorized, as nothing more than a social, party drink. Some of hip hop’s most influential musicians rapped, and still rap, about it. But lean has also claimed the lives of several rappers – including DJ Screw himself.

      While heroin and fentanyl are getting media attention, lean is still not. Peters says that there’s a racial component, and compares it to the disparity in the historical treatment of users of crack and powder cocaine. Agnich agrees: “It’s associated with
      black men, especially the football and rap music culture. It’s an issue with racism, really. If these were young, white suburban kids that were dying from this, it would probably be studied more. And that’s a sad reality.”

      <br><br> Agnich adds that another danger is the propensity for young people to be drawn to the drug, given its social association. Even if kids can’t get their hands on prescription codeine syrup, they use over-the-counter syrups like Robitussin,
      which contain a drug called dextromethorphan. This “robotripping” produces different effects – hallucinogenic, rather than depressive – but overdoses can still be extremely dangerous.
